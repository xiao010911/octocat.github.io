The _config.yml file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line with title: followed by the title you want. Add a new line with description: followed by the description you want. For example:

theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
title: Octocat's homepage
description: Bookmark this to keep an eye on my project updates!# octocat.github.io
